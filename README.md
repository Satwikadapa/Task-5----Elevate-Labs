 Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark and identify at least three different types of network protocols.

---

 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** â€“ Open-source packet analyzer

---

 Steps Performed
1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
3. Started capturing live network packets.
4. Generated network traffic by browsing and pinging servers.
5. Stopped capture after about 1 minute.
6. Filtered protocols using Wireshark display filters.
7. Identified key protocols: `TCP`, `DNS`, and `HTTP`.
8. Saved the capture as a `.pcap` file.

---

.  Protocols Identified
 1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- Reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- Used for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.

 2. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Converts domain names into IP addresses.
- Observed communication with DNS servers (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

3. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**
- Used for web page delivery in plaintext.
- Seen as `GET` requests to websites.

##  Outcome
Hands-on experience using Wireshark for:
- Capturing and analyzing live traffic
- Applying protocol filters
- Understanding how common protocols appear on the wire

---

## Notes
- The file included is a placeholder and should be replaced with a real capture from your system.
- This task was part of a Cybersecurity Internship for skill development in network analysis.
